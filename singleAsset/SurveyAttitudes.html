<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border: 1px solid #e9ecef; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 18px;">
<p><strong>Personal Carbon Trading (PCT)</strong> is a policy designed to reduce a country's carbon dioxide ('carbon') emissions by capping total individual emissions. In such a scheme, every person receives an equal number of carbon credits each year (their allowance) that can be used to purchase emissions-producing goods and services such as petrol, electricity, heating oil, or flights.</p>

<p>People who want to consume more emissions-producing goods than their allowance permits can buy extra credits from those with a smaller environmental footprint. High emitters pay for additional carbon credits, while low emitters can benefit financially by selling any spare credits. Overall, total individual emissions stay the same, and in a real PCT scheme, the number of carbon credits allocated to each person would typically be reduced gradually over time to progressively lower total emissions.</p>

{% if framing == 'baseline' %}
<p>In the task you just completed, the tradable assets can be thought of as carbon credits. By relabelling the 'asset market' you participated in as a 'carbon market,' the exercise resembles a simplified version of Personal Carbon Trading: both money and carbon credits (= assets) are needed to purchase emissions-producing goods. Credits are distributed evenly at the beginning of each round and can be traded between participants.</p>
{% else %}
<p>In the task you just completed, you engaged in a simplified Personal Carbon Trading scheme yourself.</p>
