<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border: 1px solid #e9ecef; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 18px;">
<p><strong>Personal Carbon Trading</strong> is a policy designed to reduce a country's carbon dioxide ('carbon') emissions. Individual emissions come from everyday activities such as driving, heating, or using household appliances. In such a scheme, every person would receive the same number of carbon credits each year (their allowance). These credits are required when buying carbon-intensive goods and services such as petrol, electricity, heating oil, or flights. For example, 200 credits correspond to 200 kg of carbon emissions.</p>

<p>People who use more than their allowance must buy extra credits (costing them money), while those who use less can sell their spare credits (earning money). Spare credits can be created by reducing overall consumption or by choosing less carbon-intensive options.</p>

<p>In the task you just completed, the tradable assets can be thought of as carbon credits. By relabelling the 'asset market' you participated in as a 'carbon market,' the exercise resembles a simplified version of Personal Carbon Trading: not only money, but also carbon credits (= assets), are needed to buy emission-producing goods. These credits are distributed evenly at the beginning of each round (like each year) and can be traded between participants. The overall number of credits each round stays fixed, and total emissions can be reduced by lowering the number of credits allocated.</p>
